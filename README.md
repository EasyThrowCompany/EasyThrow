We are third-year students of Applied Computer Science at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering at Warsaw University of Technology.

Our project was developed as part of the *Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Microsoft Azure-based Applications and Solutions* course.

### Purpose of the project

The aim of the project is to create a mobile app that will enable its users to easily segregate rubbish. 

### Functionality description

Based on the photo taken by the user, the app recognises the types of rubbish presented in the photo and marks them according to the bin into which they should be placed.
